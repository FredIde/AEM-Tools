# Sightly Log Filter
This tool makes it easier to filter out log messages in the error.log for just messages generated by your Javascript Sightly Use Classes.
## Use
You can use the file standalone in the logs directory by performing a chmod +x on the file, then running the file as so:

`./sightlyLogFilter.sh myUseClass.js`

Optionally you could alias this and just call the command.

This tool is covered by the LICENSE file at the root of this repository.
